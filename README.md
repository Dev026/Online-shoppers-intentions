#Revenue Prediction Project ðŸ“ˆðŸ’°

Welcome to the Revenue Prediction Project repository! In this project, we focus on predicting revenue based on various factors, employing both supervised and semi-supervised learning techniques. The key highlights include:

## Project Overview:

- **Prediction Task**: Forecasting revenue based on multiple factors.
- **Learning Techniques**: Utilizing both supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches.
- **Self-training Classifier**: Converting a classification model into a semi-supervised model using a self-training classifier.
- **Additional Methods**: Integration of K-means clustering for enhanced prediction.

## Key Features:

- **Supervised Learning**: Employing traditional supervised learning methods for accurate revenue prediction.
- **Semi-supervised Learning**: Using self-training classifiers to enhance the model with limited labeled data.
- **Clustering Techniques**: Integration of K-means clustering for additional insights.

Feel free to explore the code and delve into the methodologies applied for revenue prediction using a combination of supervised and semi-supervised learning techniques. This project provides an insightful example for those interested in predictive modeling.

Happy predicting! ðŸš€
